This is the analysis of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) Storm Database. This project involves exploring the NOAA database to analyse the characteristics of severe weather events in the United States from the year 1950 until November 2011. In order to help prioritize resources for different types of events depending on their impact, this project provides analysis of the impact of weather events on the population health as well as on economic consequences, considering estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property and crop damage. More especifically, this analysis addresses two main questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
