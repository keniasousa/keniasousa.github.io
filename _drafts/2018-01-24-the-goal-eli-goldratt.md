Reading the book "The Goal" by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt and Jeff Cox is a dream come true to any teacher. How can I teach something in an enjoyable way? You tell a story and you hide difficult concepts by teaching them through real life examples. But even better, you show the learning process, with these examples, you show the thinking process of someone going from a problem, attempting different alternatives and passing through mistakes until they reach a solution. No wonder why other authors have followed his strategy.

After over a hundred pages, you realize that in a business, the most common reason for delays in orders is bottlenecks. A bottleneck is a constraint in the production system when a resource has capacity less than the demand placed upon it. But how do you identify a bottleneck? Interestingly enough, many people fall on the trap of being overloaded with metrics and end up thinking that any measurement below the expected value means a bottleneck and must be solved. To identify a bottleneck, you need to follow the process "on the field", ask performers which areas are usually short on capacity, where parts are usually missing, where there is more inventory, etc.

Let me use an example to share what I thought were interesting concepts. My mom and my sister prepare cookies wrapped in personalized paper for birthday parties and weddings. There are two processes before assembly of the finished product: prepare the personalized paper cover and prepare the cookies.

The level of activity profited by the system is determined by its bottleneck: If cooking produces more cookies than there are papers available or before any paper is available, the result is inventory, not sales because the final product cannot be assembled.

Do not overproduce: If my mom thinks it's better not to be idle and instead of waiting for the papers, she starts cooking more cookies for the next order, she will not be able to stop in the middle of the task if the papers arrive. Instead of being beneficial, she would actually stop the process and the waiting time would increase. In addition, another set of cookies without papers does not mean a final product ready to be sold, it means more inventory.
