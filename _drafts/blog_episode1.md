# This Is None of Your Business, It's Mine

As if it wasn't enough to move to another country and have to adapt to the new life with my husband and two kids, I've decided to embark in a new adventure to open a business.

The idea came out just a month ago, on July 16, but all started one year and a half ago, when my husband and I decided to move and start a new life in Canada. The whole immigration process started in February 2017 and finished in January 2018 when we received the confirmation for permanent residency.

When the move was more certainty then doubt, my reality check made me wonder what I was supposed to do with my professional career in Canada. I had a stable and well paid job and then I found myself asking "Now, what?!", "What do I really like to do?". After deep soul searching and long talks with my husband, I finally assumed to myself teaching is one thing I really love. So, on April 2018, I started my YouTube channel with the purpose of sharing knowledge. I was already getting the habit after 4 episodes, but then the moving and settling down processes got on the way and I couldn't find time for my channel in the next three months.

By July 16th, already in Canada and settled down, I found some free time for myself and I instinctively started sending resumes out. It usually happens when we want to reduce risks. I sent my resume to every opportunity that seemed to be written directly to me, but no results. I went to job fairs, contacted recruiters, visited career advisors, but those didn't get me anywhere either. People were asking me to be flexible. This advice left me wondering 'What do they mean by that?'. And then I realized it meant if I was open to work with anything else other than business and data analysis, which is my expertise. 'Can I be any more flexible than being open to work in just about any industry?'. My questions were left to be answered by myself but it always seemed much easier for their success cases who went for a second career option.

As demotivating as it sounds, let me tell you that it wasn't. (Yeah right, of course it was!) Yes, it was, there were good days and bad days. But the more I talked to people, the more they told me how easy it was going to be for me to find an opportunity and the longer it took for me to get there. It just felt I wasn't showcasing my knowledge to the right person at the right time.

So, even on the bad days, I spent hours reading job descriptions. When I found one that fit well with my career expectations, I spent more hours adapting a word here and there on my cv. All this tweaking wasn't enough to pass the automatic tracking systems. On the good days, I was feeling flexible enough to apply to job posts that seemed so easy that I couldn't possibly miss it. But to those, there was a drawback, I was then 'overqualified'.

Two months later, oh no, it was only two weeks later, but it surely felt longer... I thought: 'I could be using this time to write my book and prepare my videos! Why do I keep on wasting time? What's keeping me from taking the leap?'.  It seemed that I was pressuring myself to keep on searching for a job. 'That's what everyone expects from you, right?! I should get a job! Is that what's keeping me from following my dream?'

So, on August 1st, Beto helped me choose a tripod and a mic and I went out prepare my videos. It felt liberating and fulfilling!

On that day, I started looking at how to open a business in Canada. I got quickly overwhelmed with so much information and I registered to my first info session organized by the Toronto Public Library. That was a bit disappointing because she talked about things I already knew: the importance to have a vision, define your target customer, check if you are ready for the challenges ahead, and on and on. What I needed were practical information on how to do it in Canada. But she could not answer any of my questions right then.

That was a tough day for me and I felt like I was losing my time away from my kids who were having a hard time adapting to the summer camp in English. I felt like canceling my one-on-one appointment with a business advisor the following day and taking the kids for a day-off with mom. Instead, there was I taking a one-and-a-half-hour trip on public transportation and reading 'The Lean Start Up Way'. When I arrived to the library, I met Karen and I gave her a sincere, unprepared and unrehearsed pitch of my dream.
