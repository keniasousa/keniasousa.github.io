I have done my first 5K run! I was with 800+ women who set the pace on Saturday, August 25 at the Toronto Womenâ€™s 10k/5k.

For you who have already ran marathons, triathlons, iron man, this is probably nothing. But maybe for many of you, this is a big deal. Remember when you started?

Just one month ago, I decided to take on running. I ran 1km on the treadmill to check if my feet hurt too much (I have a condition called XXX). The next day, my feet were the same so I tried 2km. Even though I was still reticent about my feet, I took the challenge to run outside. That's when the magic started. Each day, Toronto invited me to run a bit more. I felt more in love with this amazing city as I chose different paths. For every run, I felt free, positive and alive.

One day I ran 4km and that was enough to register for my first race. I imagined
that while running I would think of all the struggles to move to a new country and how running was helping me be even stronger and more resilient. But on that morning, I did not think any of that, I never looked back, my mind was forward looking without any effort.

While running, I checked if I was running correctly from time to time not to hurt my feet too much. I paid attention to start slow and increase progressively my pace. I watched the other runners around. Suddenly, there was silence! We entered deeper into the park and I heard the birds tweeting. It didn't seem real still there I was in the middle of this dreamlike experience. The cheers in the halfway-mark took me out of my meditative zone and the firemen offering cool water woke me up.

Reality then kicked in and my thoughts went astray. "How long will it still take? My feet hurt. My shoelace is off. Why are so many people walking? My legs seem to go against my will to run faster."" I had to make these thoughts go away. "No! I will not stop! Let's go! One more kilometer to go! I will have so many challenges ahead of me. This is just a lesson! Come on! I will keep this up until I get there!"

Then, I heard the music, the cheers, I saw so many people and I finally saw my family. Happiness bathed my body, thankfulness warmed my mind and power fleshed through my veins. I had just competed against myself and I have learned I am in command. Once again, I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and I saw that I can go even further than I had envisaged. Just keep on pushing!

I now have a baseline. 5km in 30:48s official time, 88th place out of 800+ women and 12th place in my age group. They told me it's impressive for a first run. Me, I want more!
