Why would we embark in a change in our lives without knowing what we aim to achieve? The same goes to companies. Would a company embark into process improvement just to deploy top off-the-shelf techniques? Just as you wouldn't change your kids' school or move to another country following a wave without personal motivation for it, your customers expect the same from your company. Before your company starts looking into techniques or solutions, be sure you know where you are, identify the reasons that are pushing you to take a new direction and define where you want to go.

How to do you get around to do that?

**Do you get your process?** To understand where you are, you need to know what you do, what are the outputs of your work, what are the steps taken to create them, with whom you collaborate along the way, and to whom you produce these outputs.

**Do you get your metrics?** Collecting and analyzing data is a big part in understanding how you perform these steps and how much of the desired results you reach. You want to monitor to make sure that the effort to do these steps are contributing to the expected outputs.

**Do you get your customers?** It is clear that any flaws on your performance will certainly push you to review your present situation. But if you try to attack all weaknesses at once, you will soon get distracted. Looking directly at your customers' needs and checking whether there are any gaps between what you are doing and what your customers expect will better drive you towards a new direction that brings benefits.

**Do you get your problem?** Understand why these gaps exists, ask questions until you understand what is causing them, ask again, don't stop at slammed doors or at the first easy answer. Usually, the real causes of problems are not obvious, think broadly, you will have to search in unlikely places, it will take a lot of digging, not only talking to people, but also observing them.  

**Do you get your solution?** To solve real causes of problems, you get out of your way to define an innovative solution. How do you know this solution is bringing results? Measure and evaluate the results as you go, compare them with the predefined results, and persevere when it's going well or quickly define simple actions to pivot when something is not going as expected.

**Do you get your people?** For all this to happen, everyone involved needs to be passionated about making things better for their customers, colleagues and for themselves. Sure, this is not the reality, we are humans and even optimists have bad days. I believe that if people are open to learn and change, we can get anywhere. The key is to get people interested in the problem you are trying to solve.

There is much more involved when a change is needed and that can vary for each new case. Consider your situation precisely and dive in. And remember that in process improvement, we target for simplicity.
