## Steps

We can follow a 4-step process to roll out business architecture and build end-to-end processes that are seamless for customers. This flow is composed of small experiments that enable learning and improving.

### Plan

Prioritize the processes that need more attention focused on customers needs.

Understanding exactly what customers are going through is a good starting point to understand limitations in the process. There are different techniques we could use such as process modeling, value stream mapping, mapping the customer journey, etc. The point here is to base it on actual observation. 

This is the basis to analyze the gaps, identify the reasons, and define hypothesis that will be tested and refined in practice.

### Do

While the work is done, take note of what happens. This is an important moment to collect data so we can use it to identify insights and action plans to improve the customer experience.

### Check

Learn about what is working and what is not. Clearly analyze what happened in each step of the process and highlight the successes as well as the difficulties with everyone. This is aligned to lean thinking which advocates for the exposure of problems so they can be fixed sooner.

### Act

Share learning and define future state direction. The purpose is to follow this iterative process to try each idea and define actions based on what we learned. This is the point of the process we share what we learned and it takes us back to the planning table to keep on adapting. Defining changes in processes that solve a current problem is a way to constantly evolve by improving one thing at a time.


## Modeling

### Representation

When we are analyzing the current situation and there are several teams in the same function, maybe they are separated by organizational structures or location, it's important to define an effective process that takes the best from each team. A harmonized process across different teams allows us to track their evolution towards common goals. This is similar to how franchises work. 

### Notation

Transitioning to BPMN can be overwhelming so I recommend to keep the convention simple and start training analysts and business stakeholders on a set of most frequently used symbols. 


## Impact of Changes

One of the first advantages the organization gets after the business architecture is define is to see the impact of changes.

## Tool



1. The **Business Strategy** view has the strategic and tactical goals that are mapped to metrics that are tracked to identify how the organization is trending to achieve its goals.

2. The **Business Capabilities** view has the business functions of the organization that are mapped to the organizational units that perform these functions.

3. The **Value stream** view has the end-to-end activities that are done by business units to create an outcome to stakeholders.

4. The **Business Knowledge** view has the definitions shared within the organization, including its data assets, so they can communicate and operate in harmony.

5. The **Organizational** view has the mapping between business capabilities and the organizational structure including business units and roles.

6. The **Technology** view has the list of systems/ applications and technology assets that support business processes and the deployment of these systems.



1. **Business Architecture**: maps the business objectives, the business processes, the business functions, and the organization structure.

2. **Data Architecture**: defines data standards starting from business entities to the level of physical assets used in systems.

3. **Technology**: describes application landscape that supports business processes, and how they interact with each other and with users.

3. **Technical Architecture**: defines the technology components used to develop the applications and their relationship to each other.


- **Business Strategy**: which functions and business units are operating to achieve our goals, which processes are impacted, what terminology is shared to guide the strategy?

- **People**: are they supporting organizational goals, are the responsibilities reflected in the processes, are functions mapped to the organization structure, is the data shared between different functions?

- **Value stream**: do the activities help achieve the goals, have we identified how stakeholders, functions and business units collaborate, is there a common terminology across processes?

- **Organizational**: are business units and roles linked to business functions and are they aware of how they support the organizational goals, are the processes useful to guide them with enough flexibility, is terminology supporting good communication? 

- **Business Knowledge**: are there specific terms that are used differently that cause confusion? is data accessible to understand, operate and improve processes?

- The **Applications**: which applications support key processes, which roles operate core applications, how does data flow across applications?


We can summarize them in domains to define the structure of the organization:

1. **Business Architecture**: maps the business objectives, the business processes, the business functions, and the organization structure.

2. **Data Architecture**: defines data standards starting from business entities to the level of physical assets used in systems.

3. **Applications Architecture**: describes the application landscape that supports business processes, and how they interact with each other and with users.
