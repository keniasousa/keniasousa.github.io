### What are the key data flows?

Now with systems in the game, it is time to consider interfaces between them
that directly impact the process execution.
So, I came up with a diagram of my own that shows few of the key data flows
between systems.

The goal in adding data flows is to show key interfaces between two pair of systems.
It's not to show all of the interfaces between them.
Selecting just key interfaces help identify potential sources of issues in
communication between systems that could eventually break the process and
impact the end customer directly.
Interfaces require special attention to make sure data actually arrives to the
destination correctly.

Another goal is to show where there aren't interfaces. So, when an activity is
added that requires communication between two systems that did not interact before,
more attention is required than with systems that already work together.

For some projects, I noticed that it was useful to highlight which systems
are developed in house and which are corporate software developed in other departments
or off-the-shelf solutions.
When there are different system owners, there have been frequent cases of interface issues,
thus, it helps to know which owner to contact when needed.
