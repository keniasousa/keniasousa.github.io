I'm the first to defend critical thinking for myself and for my children. They're both in elementary school and there is one thing I want them to learn is to have critical thinking when learning something new. Critical thinking will prepare them to analyze the problem from different perspectives and make an informed judgement and make a decision. 

We're all confronted with the use of genrative AI (GenAI) tools in our daily lives, in our children's learning programs and in our jobs. But we aren't sure of their impact on critical thinking.

I want to share what a group of Microsoft Researchers found out when they surveyed 319 knowledge works to investigate the impact of GenAI on their critical thinking.
