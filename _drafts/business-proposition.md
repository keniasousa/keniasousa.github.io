1. Define The Problem: What is the problem you are trying to solve? Why is it a problem? Who is it a problem to? Who is affected by this problem, and how?

Last time I was in a job fair, I asked the hiring manager what were the kinds of projects they were working on. After she answered me, the person right next to me asked what programming language they were using. I constantly see people being focused on technical skills.

Young graduates, junior professionals, and all those who are experiencing a shift in their careers have acquired technical skills but they do not know how to approach a business problem. When they arrive in a company, they expect detailed directions of what to do so they can apply the techniques they have learned, but they are not able to apply critical thinking to analyze the entire situation. This problem affects companies directly because they cannot rely on novices with a project.

2. Propose Your Solution: What is your solution? How does it solve the problem? Why does it solve the problem? Who does it solve the problem for?

I will create two products: 1) a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) with supporting material and 2) coaching people to help companies build critical thinking teams. The teaching approach will use two main techniques: business processes models to improve communication, execution and control, and data analysis to consolidate what works and to pivot what doesn't.

This solution provides a roadmap to novices to guide them to acquire domain knowledge, take a holistic view to understand the business and propose solutions. Novices will take a proactive approach in problem solving and will go beyond applying mechanical solutions. Companies will build teams that take ownership of their solutions.


3. Defend Your Solution: Why is your solution the best option? Why are YOU the person to solve this problem? What is your and your business' unfair advantage over your competitors? Is it your experience, your approach, your team, etc.?

My biggest unfair advantage over competitors is that I bring customer focus from Human-Computer Interaction, and domain knowledge, critical thinking and a holistic approach from Business Process Management into the technical world of Data Analysis. I take this unique idea that the market has not yet started to explore and I bring my years of experience and passion for teaching that will enable novices to make a difference in the market place from the beginning of their careers.
