How can we become customer centric?


One of the things I like about modeling business processes is to start thinking about the actors.

- Which are the roles involved in this process?

If thinking about roles is difficult, remember that behind what we call roles, there are people. You can start by listing the people doing the tasks. In a hair salon, Oliver, Leticia and Jonas are hair stylists, Tamara is the waxing diva, Oliver is the founder and manager, and Leticia is the financial manager.

Quickly you discover some people play different roles. Oliver will have different responsibilities as hair stylist, founder and manager. A good reason for differentiating the roles in a process, not the people, is to clarify the tasks per role.

Names help while looking within the company, however when we start looking outwards. Who else does the beauty salon work with?

Suppliers of beauty products, suppliers of machinery, cleaning services, and customers. We could treat external actors

Why is it so important
