The elephant in the room, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is disrupting and taking some jobs, but other opportunities are arising. Everything changes very often in Information Technology (IT) so we need to embrace these changes and adapt to grow with it.

The purpose of Copilot is to make us more productive at work. We can see it as an assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to give insights from data. This assistant will automate repetitive tasks integrating seamlessly with Microsoft 365 applications. For example, summarize meeting transcripts from Microsoft Teams, and create presentations, documents, emails in a consistent manner.

State statitics on how many companies are adopting copilot for all their employees worldwide. What companies or industries are lagging behing?

More specific examples of activities:

## Automate data analysis
Analyze contextual and historical data from files, emails and draw insights so we can focus on the decision-making.
Analyze data in real time to do business forecast and planning, for example to implement Just in Time production. Add example of Mini cooper based on constructions on highways and weather to enable delivery of parts on time.
Add drawbacks

## Automate problem-solving
Analyze past successful strategies to idenfy suggestions for current problems.
Add drawbacks

## Automate brainstorming
Create content suggestions and variations - so we can focus on going beyond
Drawback:It does not create out of the box ideas, it is based on what has been created before

## Automate solutions
Ability to connect agents from external applications with Microsoft copilot to extend copilot capabilities beyond the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. 

# Responsible use of AI
Microsoft follows AI principles: fairness, privacy and reliability, and it respects data governance policies.
Data protection through encyption and access controls, compliance with regulatory requirements.
What if the output is wrong? We need a human to review the output as a source of decision-mkaing process, not to output the decision.
Add overview and links for reference.

# Configure control over data
