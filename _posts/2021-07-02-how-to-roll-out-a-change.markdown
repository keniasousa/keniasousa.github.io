Every company wants to give the best customer experience. But even when they offer usable applications, there are still broken links in that experience that leave their customers unsatisfied. How can we find what's wrong? Where do we start?

What sometimes happens is that each department has an efficient process but the gap lies in the communication between them. The reality is that companies already have some kind of representation of their processes, whether in text or in modeling tools. And when we try to connect the dots, we realize that each department uses different definitions and entities for the same meaning in the customer view. For example, a participant of an education program wants to be identified as a person, not with different identifications whether this semester they are a student and the next they are a volunteer. 

So, before we are able to close the gap in the customer experience, we need to create a business architecture. This holistic view harmonizes how we represent entities in a common repository to increase transparency and make it easier to identify impact of changes across different teams.

We can follow a 4-step process to roll out business architecture and build end-to-end processes that are seamless for customers. This flow is composed of small experiments that enable learning and improving;

**1) Plan: Define the process prioritizing customers**

Prioritize the processes that need more attention focused on customers needs. 

Understanding exactly what customers are going through is a good starting point to understand limitations in the process. There are different techniques we could use such as process modeling, value stream mapping, mapping the customer journey, etc. The point here is to base it on actual observation to get an accurate view of the current situation. In lean, the Japanese word "Gemba" is used to represent that we go in the actual place where the work is happening so we are able to understand the impact of the problem.

This current process is the basis to analyze the gaps, identify the reasons and define hypothesis that will be tested and refined in practice.

**2) Do: Do the work**

Take note of what happens. This is an important moment to collect data so we can use it to identify insights and action plans to improve the customer experience.

**3) Check: Learn about what is working and what is not**

Clearly analyze what happened in each step of the process and highlight the successes as well as the difficulties with everyone. This is my favorite step and it  is aligned to lean thinking that advocates exposing problems so we can fix them.

**4) Act: Share learning and define future state direction**

The purpose is to follow this iterative process to try each idea and define actions based on what we learned. This is the point of the process we share what we learned and it takes us back to the planning table to keep on adapting. Defining changes in processes that solve a current problem is a way to constantly evolve by improving one thing at a time.

**PDCA as a support to learn and improve:**

According to the Nature Human Behaviour Journal, people have a bias that more is strategic and neglect to see simple as strategic. But given the choice, the percentage of people choosing simplification strategies increases, which is good news to advocate for simplicity to make transitions easier.

Going through any change can be difficult but following these steps can simplify this journey by helping us embrace uncertainty and learning as we go. We don't know what we'll find out when we check how the process went and what will happen after we make the improvements. That is the reason for experimenting in an iterative cycle so everyone learns by doing.

*Some other simplification strategies that can help in the transition:*

Representation: When there are several teams in the same function, maybe they are separated by organizational structures or location, it's important to define an effective process that takes the best from each team. A harmonized process across different teams allows us to track their evolution towards common goals. This is similar to how franchises work. 

Notation: Transitioning to BPMN can be overwhelming so I recommend to keep the convention simple and start training analysts and business stakeholders on a set of most frequently used symbols.
