Louvain School of Management</a> (LSM) doctoral day on January 12, 2009. This day was organized with a presentation for each
scientific center of excellence and several posters from PhD students from these centers that range from marketing, asset
management, supply chain management, innovative strategies and information engineering. There were around forty to fifty people
in this event among professors and PhD students from

FUNDP</a> and

I was invited to represent the center of excellence
PRISME (Pole of Research on Information and Services Management and Engineering) with a team of nearly 80 researchers.
This was an honor for me to have my research recognized as a mature cross-disciplinary work and share it with people from other
centers.

<br>It has indeed been through interactions with other centers that I developed interesting researches, such as the one on integrating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with Operational Research
(on my Master dissertation) and with Knowledge Engineering (Tamodia 2004) with professors from UNIFOR (Universidade de Fortaleza) and UCL.

My research, done at HCI lab in the Business School of Management (LSM), integrates HCI with Business Process Management. There are several challenges to be addressed and I am currently applying this research in a
large organization to analyze how the proposed strategy can help systemsâ€™ end users accomplish their day-to-day tasks according
to business expectations.
