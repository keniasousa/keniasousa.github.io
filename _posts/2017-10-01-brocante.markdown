My husband and I took some French lessons with our neighbor, who is a retired school teacher.
In one of our classes, she reviewed our CVs and found out we are both working in IT.

One day, she came over to our home asking if my husband and I could help her with
the registrations to the next neighborhood flea market she organizes with another friend.

She explained that applicants send an email requesting one or more spots in the flea
market. She needs to treat these emails one by one. If any contact information is
missing, she has to request it to the applicant. Once she gets the complete set of
information, she fills in a spreadsheet until the list reaches the 250 spots. After that,
any new request is put on a waiting list. For each request added in the spreadsheet,
she writes an email to explain the status to the applicant: confirmed or on waiting list.

######## correct task text: send message about market spot; check completeness of application; inform application status; add applicant in confirmed list; receive application status

This process is quite time consuming for them and knowing we are IT geeks, she
hoped we could help them automate it.

Our immediate idea was to eliminate these three tasks that are a big workload for
them and a source of mistakes. And a simple online form would be the perfect solution
that needed to be ready in a week.

Since IT is a different world for them, I first showed a simple form I use to request my
contact lenses online. With this, they had an idea of what applicants could use. We then
quickly created a Google form to discuss the fields.

While I discussed with them the fields, my husband developed
a first version of the UI in Django. One great advantage of using Django is that an
initial product can be quickly delivered and it comes with the administration ready.

As soon as they saw the UI, they were very happy but sadly announced that
they had been advertising, for the past six months, the use of email as a way to
apply for the flea market. So, we had to find a solution to let everyone know that we would have a new system for
registration instead of sending emails. We thought of Facebook pages or the neighborhood
newsletter, but the schedule was too tight to be feasible in a week. So, we
decided to send an automatic message to each request received. That seemed to solve the
issue because the registration period had not started yet. And for your surprise, most people
do follow this start date, even though it is via e-mail. For few people who had sent a request before
the application start date, we would need to simply write a message. For the others who were
waiting for the deadline, the message would go as an automatic reply.

After they agreed on the message, my husband set up the automatic reply on their
Google account.

I explained to them the new process by actually doing it:

1. I sent an email requesting a place in the flea market from my laptop.
2. I showed them the automatic reply on my Inbox to show what everyone would see.
3. I clicked on the application link in the message.
4. I registered in the application. Happy to be the first to get my spot in the market this year! :)
5. We saved the link to the application administration in their bookmarks.
6. I asked them to go in the administration to see my registration.
7. One of them clicked on the button "Confirm receipt of request".
8. I showed them the automatic confirmation in my Inbox.

"Magic!", they both said with big smiles on their faces. They were thrilled with
how easy it was compared to the previous years of manual work.

This is what the new process would look like for them now:

Showing the process live, helped them realize that they had forgotten something.
From their experience from previous years, they still received
phone calls for registration because some people do not have an email account.
Thus, they would need to be able to register some people on their behalf. To solve this scenario,
we quickly set the email field as optional from the administration.

When the first day of application came and the automatic emails started rolling,
we got around 10 request in 30 minutes and around 50 requests on the first day.
As the requests kept coming, we realized that people are very creative trying to
get as many spots as possible. The organizers would face issues later on if they
gave more spots for a person instead of giving the opportunities for more families
to participate. They requested us to implement a business rule that allows only one registration
per email address. If someone wanted more than one spot, they would have to get
together with their family members and friends.

The next step in the process was the confirmation of the registration. It went on
pretty smoothly because they only needed to click in a button to confirm each registration.
As they went through the list, they requested the possibility to delete duplicate
applications which were done before the new business rule was implemented.

The process now had a few changes after they actually started using the system:

In total, there were 250 registrations for the flea market and it was a great
success. Seeing all these people negotiating and socializing is a great experience.
It was my first participation and it will definitely be one of many.

You can imagine how happy they were with the new process using an application?
I guess you can. But it is hard to describe how I have felt: fulfilled could start to
describe it.

The best of this voluntary work was:
- applying my knowledge in a different domain.
- learning that even in volunteering you have deadlines.
- experiencing agile development from home.
- applying business process analysis in a tiny project.
- having your work recognized and thanked for.

I am the one to say: Thank you for finding us!
