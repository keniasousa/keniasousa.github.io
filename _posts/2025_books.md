I want to share the best books I read in 2005.

<!-- more -->

**1. Violeta by Isabel Allende**

This is a beautifully written story of a woman, her personal experiences interwoven with significant historical events. Isabel Allende is a master in the art of writing, making me cry and laugh throughout the book.

**2. Mindsight by Daniel Siegel**

This book has helped me learn a great deal about the possibilities of personal transformation, especially as I work through overcoming my fear of swimming in open water. This is a book I'll keep returning to review some key practices. Next time I read it, I'll definitely take notes. This is the best book on mental health that I've read so far. I highly recommend it!


**3. A Swim in a Pond in the Rain by George Saunders**

I love reading, but I also love writing. I probably love reading more than writing, so I read books about writing. This is one of the best books about writing that I’ve read so far. The author will take you through seven short stories and share his technical and philosophical opinion of what makes these great stories. It has helped me open my mind and make deeper reflections of what it means to me.

Happy Reading!
