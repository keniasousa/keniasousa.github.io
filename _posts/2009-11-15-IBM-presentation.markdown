I was awarded with the IBM PhD Fellowship Award, granted to a select group of 40 PhD students from a set of 600 competitors all over the world. The idea behind my PhD thesis, conducted at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL), is the Usi4Biz framework, which aims to link business processes with user interfaces, has been producing very positive impacts.

During the award ceremony, I had the opportunity to present my research to IBM Executives, including the General Manager IBM Belgium/Luxembourg, Mr. Bart Van Den Meersche, at the IBM Forum Brussels.

<br>The prize offered by IBM will guarantee an extension of the research for 8 more months, enough time to conclude the remaining aspects under investigation. Meanwhile, I will spend 7 weeks of cooperation, divided in 3 missions within these 8 months, with researchers at the <a href="http://www.watson.ibm.com/index.shtml" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.watson.ibm.com');" target="_blank">IBM Watson Research Center</a> in New York. In my first mission, I contribute with researches on the fields of business process and user interface design, conducted by Mr. <a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_people.nsf/pages/hull.index.html" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/domino.research.ibm.com');" target="_blank">Rick Hull</a> and Mrs. Noi Sukaviriya.
