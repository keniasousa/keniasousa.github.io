I want to share the books I've read in 2005.

<!-- more -->

This year, my reading list looks very different from previous years. I gravitated more towards non-fiction books and moved away from thrillers, leaning instead into contemporary literature that explore ordinary lives with depth and tenderness, particularly the beautiful work from Elizabeth Strout.

These are my top reads of the year:

**1. Violeta by Isabel Allende**

A beautifully written portrait of a woman whose personal story is deeply intertwined with significant historical events. Isabel Allende is a master storyteller, she made me cry, laugh and reflect throughout the book.

**2. Mindsight by Daniel Siegel**

This book taught me a great deal about the brain and the real possibilities of personal transformation. It has been especially meaningful as I work through overcoming my fear of swimming in open water. Mindsight is a book I know I'll return to again and again, next time with a notebook in hand. It's the best book on mental health I've read so far, and I highly recommend it!

**3. A Swim in a Pond in the Rain by George Saunders**

I love reading, and I also love writing, though if I'm honest, I probably love reading a bit more. That's why I'm drawn to books about writing, and this one stands out. Through seven short stories, George Saunders offers his technical and philosophical insights into what makes great fiction work. This book challenged what I think about storytelling, opening my mind to deeper reflections and what it means to me as a reader and aspiring writer.

**4. The Bee Sting by Paul Murray**

The Bee Sting is an extraordinary novel that explores the same events through the perspectives of different family members, revealing how profoundly reality can shift depending on who is telling the story. What impressed me most is that each character’s viewpoint is written in a distinct style, a bold choice that made this reading experience so unique. This is not an easy book, it tackles heavy themes such as mental illness, domestic violence, teen cybersecurity, bullying, self-acceptance, and more, but that depth is precisely what gives it its power. If you’re willing to engage with challenging subjects and complex emotions, this is a book I highly recommend.

**5. Untangled by Lisa Damour**

This is a must-read for parents navigating the teenage years. As a mom of a pre-teen girl and a teen boy, I found this book incredibly helpful. While the focus is on girls, the insights apply to understanding teenagers of any gender. It helps understand what changes are part of normal development, how to respond, and how to recognize signs that may require closer attention. If you’ve ever heard Lisa Damour speak, you can imagine how good it feels to read her book, it's clear and grounded in real-life experience.

Have you read any of these books? I'd love to hear what stood out to you from your own reading this year.
