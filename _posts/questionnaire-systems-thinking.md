Systems Thinking Maturity Questionnaire

Instructions:
For each statement, rate your organization on a scale of 1–5:
1 = Strongly disagree | 3 = Somewhat true | 5 = Strongly agree

1. Systems Thinking

| Statement  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Leaders look beyond symptoms to understand root causes. |   |   |   |   |  |
| Decisions consider long-term consequences, not just short-term targets. |   |   |   |   |  |
| Leaders encourage questioning assumptions and mental models. |   |   |   |   |  |

2. Teams

| Statement  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Work is designed and managed across functions rather than optimized within silos. |   |   |   |   |  |
| Teams understand how their work affects upstream and downstream processes |   |   |   |   |  |
| Accountability is shared for end-to-end outcomes, not just local performance. |   |   |   |   |  |

3. Learning

| Statement  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| We actively use feedback loops to adjust decisions. |   |   |   |   |  |
| Failures are treated as learning opportunities.|   |   |   |   |  |
| Improvements are tested, observed, and adapted rather than rolled out as one-time fixes.|   |   |   |   |  |

4. Mental Models

| Statement  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| We use visual tools (e.g. process maps, value streams) to understand complexity. |   |   |   |   |  |
| Problems are framed in terms of interactions and patterns, not isolated events.|   |   |   |   |  |
| Data is used to understand trends and relationships, not just point-in-time metrics.|   |   |   |   |  |

5. Vision
UPDATE
| Statement  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employees at multiple levels are trained in systems thinking concepts.|   |   |   |   |  |
| Collaboration and knowledge sharing are actively rewarded.|   |   |   |   |  |
| Change initiatives consider people, process, technology, and environment together.|   |   |   |   |  |

Scoring & Interpretation

15–30 | Early / Reactive
Focused on fixing issues in isolation. Systems thinking is limited or implicit.

31–50 | Developing / Transitional
Growing awareness of interdependencies. Some systems tools and cross-functional thinking are emerging.

51–65 | Integrated / Proactive
Systems thinking is embedded in decision-making, improvement, and culture.

66–75 | Advanced / Adaptive
The organization continuously senses, learns, and adapts as a living system.
