I have been doing data analytics for some time and now I'm learning about how to install Tableau Server on the Cloud.  It took a lot of reading, research and trials to get it done so I want to share the step-by-step process with anyone who is doing the same as me - with less than 20 steps.

When the kids heard I had my own server, they thought I was playing Minecraft by myself.You see, they have their own Minecraft Server on the cloud and they can invite their friends to build new villages together. This has been extremely useful during the pandemic when we have to minimize the play dates in person.

And they are right, I am playing because data is my kind of fun, I've been having fun with Tableau Prep, Desktop and Server.

The reasons a company would want to install Tableau Server in the Cloud varies, but from start-ups to large corporations, moving to the cCloud can bring several advantages, such as:

- It decreases operational costs since you pay as you go
- It is more efficient since you don't have to wait to setup the infra-structure yourself
- It allows to respond to fluctuating demands by scaling out according to the market and user needs
- It allows to test and learn before defining the analytics strategy
- It enables publishing centralized data sources as a single source of truth across the organization

It's not difficult to do the setup, but it can be a bit overwhelming when trying it out for the first time. By just following the steps in the [Tableau Help for Linux][server-linux-setup]{:target="_blank"}, I was able to deploy a Tableau Server in Microsoft Azure in Linux.

The steps I followed were:

**In Microsoft Azure** 

1. Create a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure

Follow step 1 on this [page to Self-Deploy a Single Tableau Server on Microsoft Azure][self-deploy-Tableau-Server-Microsoft-Azure].

Make sure to go through all the items, when creating an inbound security rule, make sure to open the following default port for Tableau Server traffic: create one rule for the HTTPS service with the port 8850 used by the Tableau Services Manager. Information available on [Local firewall configuration][local-firewall-configuration].


**Install the Tableau Server package**

The instructions I used following the steps in this page to [Install Tableau Server and initialize Tableau Services Manager][server-linux-setup]

2. In the local folder, create a user with sudo access (with administrative access) to the computer where you want to install Tableau Server:

$ mkdir ~/.ssh/kenia

mv Downloads/kenia.pem ~/.ssh/kenia

$ cd ~/.ssh/kenia

$ chmod 400 kenia.pem

$ mv kenia.pem ~/.ssh/kenia

3. Log on as a user with sudo access to the virtual machine where you want to install Tableau Server:

$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/kenia/kenia.pem kenia@<ip_address_virtual_machine>

4. Download the Tableau Server .rpm or .deb installer package from the [Tableau Server Downloads and Release Notes page][download-tableau-server]. 

5. Navigate to the directory where you copied the .rpm or .deb package.

$ cd ~/.ssh/kenia 

6. In the server, use the package manager to install the Tableau Server package

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get -y install gdebi-core

7. In the local machine, give permission to the user to access the virtual machine 

$ scp -i ~/.ssh/kenia/kenia.pem tableau-server-<version>_amd64.deb kenia@<ip_address_virtual_machine>:/home/kenia

8. In the server, install the Tableau Server package

$ sudo gdebi -n tableau-server-<version>_amd64.deb


**Initialize Tableau Services Manager (TSM)**

9. Navigate to the scripts directory

$ cd /opt/tableau/tableau_server/packages/scripts.<version_code>/

10. Start TSM 

You must include this parameter to accept the Tableau Server End User License Agreement (EULA). The EULA is available in the following location:
/opt/tableau/tableau_server/packages/docs.<version_code>/Commercial_EULA.txt

$ sudo ./initialize-tsm --accepteula
                            
11. Set the password for my account to login in the Server

$ sudo passwd kenia

12. Log off and log on again to the terminal before you configure Tableau Server. 


**Activate and Register Tableau Server**

13. Activate and Register Tableau Server: 

I followed the steps using the [TSM web interface][activate-tableau-server]:

- Sign in to [Tableau Services Manager Web UI][sign-in-tsm-web-ui]
- On the Activate page, Enter or paste your product key and click Activate License
- When youâ€™re finished activating product keys, click Next
- On the Register page, enter your information into the fields and click Register
 

**Configure Tableau Server**

14. Configure initial server settings

I followed the steps using the [TSM web interface][configure-tableau-server] with local identity store:.
Fill in the setup page and click on Initialize. 

15. Create an administrator account

Follow the steps on the page to [Add and Adminsitrator Account][add-admin-account]. I accessed the computer remotely and run the tabcmd initialuser command:

tabcmd initialuser --server http://localhost --username 'tableau-admin' 

16. Access the Tableau Server

Visit https://<ip_address_virtual_machine>

17. Logon in the Tableau Server using the password for the user (in my case, user kenia) or administrator


**Access Tableau Server**

18. After the Server is set up, the process to start the server is:

- Start the virtual machine in [Microsoft Azure][MS-Azure]
- Sign in [Tableau Services Manager][my-TSM]
- Click on Start the Tableau Server in TSM
- Access the [Tableau Server][my-TS]

19. When you are done, stop the Tableau Server:
- Click on Stop the Tableau Server in TSM
- Stop the virtual machine in [Microsoft Azure][MS-Azure]

There is no need to deactivate the license because a restart of the virtual machine will preserve the MAC address, as explained in this [Microsoft Developer Network Forum][static-MAC-addresses-Azure-VMs].

Here's a sneak peak of the dashboard I published in my Tableau Server. I'm ready to play and publish on my new Server!
