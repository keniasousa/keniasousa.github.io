I want to share the best books I read in 2024.

**1. Just Another Missing Person by Gillian McAllister**

I've been reading thrillers for a long time but I've been disappointed when I can tell the end or when it's not that surprising. So I must highlight an author who defies the laws of writing. As I kept guessing, she did an unexpected knot in the story that blew me away. Thank you for your innovation and creativity, Gillian!

**2. Turtles All The Way Down by John Green**

I'm usually around teens because of my kids and I used to think that mental health was something I read about. But I have witnessed it too close in our communities. Then, I worried: would I be able to help someone if I ever needed to? This book showed me how a person with mental health issues thinks. It made me realize how hard it is to help. 

Spoiler: It was eye-opening to realize that from the outside, people think they are trying to harm themselves, but they aren't. They are fighting against thoughts they want to control, but can't.

**3. Combats et Metamorphose d'une femme by Edouard Louis**

You can read this book in one sitting, but I didn't because I wanted it to last longer. The author takes you through his life to explain how his relationship with his mother changed. It's a love story that only blossoms when his mother starts her metamorphosis. Beautifully written by a French author.

**4. Do Hard Things by Steve Magness**

I started reading this book to help me with my sports challenges, and I was surprised at how much it's about how you react in tough moments. The greatest advice is to allow yourself to take steps back and slow down. You don't have to overexpose yourself; sometimes, you must assess and adapt to keep doing hard things. But that, we all know, it is hard to do! Read more about my view of  ["The Science of Choice"][science-choice]{:target="_blank"}.

**5. Study for Obedience by Sarah Berstein**

I love reading a book from an award-winning author. It's usually a good story, it is well-written and has hidden messages that make you reflect. This book by a Canadian author has it all. It's one of those books if you analyze each passage with a group of people, each person could get a different understanding. And that, for me, is a powerful storyteller.

Happy Reading!
