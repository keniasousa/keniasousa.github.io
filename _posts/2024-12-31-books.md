I want to share the best books I read in 2024.

**1. Just Another Missing Person by Gillian McAllister**

I've been reading thrillers for a long time but I've been disappointed when I can tell the end or when it's not that surprising. So I must highlight an author when she defies the laws of writing. As I keept on guessing, she did an unexpected knot in the story that blew me away. Thank you for your innovation and creativity, Gillian!

**2. Turtles All The Way Down by John Green**

I'm usually around teens because of my kids and I used to think that mental health was something I read about. But I have witnessed it too close in our communities. Then, I worried, would I be able to help someone if I ever needed to? This book showed me how a person with mental health issues thinks. It made me realize how hard it is to help. 

Spolier: It was eye opening to realized that from the outside, people think they are trying to harm themselves, but they aren't. They are fighting against thoughts that they want to control, but can't.

**3. Combats et Metamorphose d'une femme by Edouard Louis**

This is a short book you can read in one sitting but I didn't because I wanted it to last longer. The author takes you through his life to explain how the relationship with his mother changed. It's a love story that only blossoms when his mother starts her metamorphosis. Beautifully written by French author.

**4. Do Hard Things by Steve Magness**

I started reading this book to help me with my sports challenges and I was happily surprised of how much it's aout how you react in tough moments. The greatest advice for me was to allow yourself to take steps back, slow down. You don't have to overexpose yourself all the time, sometimes you have to assess and adapt so you can keep doing hard things. But that, we all know, it's hard to do!

**5. Study for Obidience by Sarah Berstein**

I love reading a book from an award-winning author. It's usually a good sotry, it's well written and it has hidden messages that make you reflect. This book by a Canadian author has it all. It's one of those books if you analuyze each passage with a group of peoplke, each person could get a different understanding. And that, for me, is a powerful storyteller.

Happy Reading!
