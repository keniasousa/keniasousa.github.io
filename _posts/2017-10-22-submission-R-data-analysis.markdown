For almost 12 years, I have worked as an academic researcher and one strong part
of this work is done writing papers for conferences and journals. Putting your
research into a few pages is a demanding task and a crucial exercise to learn how
to pass a convincing message to readers. Receiving evaluators' feedback can be a
daunting experience when you are first put in contact with renowned scholars, but
one you in which you learn and grow to appreciate.

Once I started mastering the art of conferences after years of volunteering, I
was invited to organise some workshops and participate in scientific program
committees.
