This year, I invite you to read two books with me. The Fifth Discipline and The Toyota Way to Service Excellence.  As I started reading the Fifth Discipline, I remembered that the book "The Toyota Way to Service Excellence" by Jeffrey Liker could help us put the Systems Thinking in practice using Lean Thinking.

Why is the Fifth Discipline important? Why should I have a systems thinking approach?

<!-- more -->

We tend to focus on what we have to do and can't see how our actions impact others. Even harder it is to see that the effect of our own actions come back to impact us. That is where systems thinking helps: You can only undertand systems by contemplating the whole, not any individual part.

Let's start by understanding what we mean by a **system** in ***Systems Thinking***. A system can be a business, a school, a university, a team, and it also applies to a rainstorm system, a production system, a healthcare system, etc. 

So if we take an organization as a system, we can use Systems Thinking as a way of looking at it differently: looking at the actions and interactions, not as isolated parts of the system, but as interrelated, how they work together, and how they impact each other. Systems Thinking helps us see how our own actions create the problems we experience and how to make changes.

When an organization follows Systems Thinking and all its best practices, tools and disciplines, it is called a ***Learning Organization***. I like the term because it represents an organization that is always in the state of learning, continually expanding its capacity to create its future.

## Learning Disabilities

Peter Senge identified learning disabilities that don't let organizations recognize threats to their growth, understand the implications of those threats or come up with alternatives to change:

**I am my position:** If we focus on our positions only, we have little sense of responsibility for the results when all positions interact and we don't see how our own actions extend beyond that position.

**The illusion fo taking charge:** When we respond to issues only reacting to events, we can't see the longer-term patterns that lie behind the events and can't understand the root causes of these patterns.

**The parable of the boiled frog:** When organizations are set up to react to sudden changes, they can't feel slow, gradual changes and won't stop to look at the processes that is posing the greatest threats.

**The delusion of learning from experience:** When the negative effects of their actions happen elsewhere, they don't know they need to look at cross functional lines to analyze their issues.

## Systems Thinking

What we want to do is to watch out for those behaviours, avoid and solve them with a new way of thinking. But, Systems Thinking alone is not enough to help us become a learning organization, that's why Peter Senge calls it the **Fifth Discipline**, it needs to be integrated with other disciplines. Systems Thinking also needs teams willing to:

1. Build a **shared vision**, a picture of the future that we want to create together. Here, there is an important distinction, we're looking to build a vision that fosters commitment rather than compliance.
  
2. Look inward, being open to unearth the shortcomings in our present ways of working (understanding our **mental models**).
    
3. Be made up of lifelong learners, committed to our **personal mastery**
  
4. **Learn as a team** so we have the skills to learn with each other and innovate. 

5. See actions, events, behaviors as **systems**, interconnected, looking at the larger picture and how we interact beyond individual perspectives, looking at end-to-end processes deeply, looking for the root causes of behaviors so we can change them.

## Lean Thinking

As we learn about Systems Thinking, we can see important concepts from Lean Thinking: 

- Train and develop people through **repeated practice**, challenge people to do their best as an individual and as a team,

- Question our assumptions and look for the **root cause** of problems, 

- Analyze end-to-end **processes** looking for wastes that cause deviations from the process so we can **continuously improve** towards our goals.

To help organizations get started, Liker proposes a model focused on philosophy, process, people and problem solving.

Not surprisingly, start with a long-term systems thinking approach to connect processes, people and problem solving in one strategy, creating a culture that challenges people to learn and grow. 

Design your business processes. Start with a high level view, understand what customers want, how much and when, then design the key processes to achieve these goals. After that, get to the detailed design, that's where the heavy lifting of continous improvement happens by team members. They are understanding the current state, developing future state visions, experimenting the changes, and getting closer to the vision.

## Conclusion

There isn't a recipe to be copied and it's challenging to put it in practice. But we're in a good pathway if we start designing processes and continually refine them to deliver the services that customers want.

Where are you in this process? How does your organization learn? What’s one small experiment you could run to strengthen Systems Thinking?

## Key Concepts

- Lean means doing more with less, like a professional athlete.
- Continuous Improvement means that we're constantly challending the way we work to find a better way.
- Kaizen means "change for the better", systematically working toward overcoming obstacle after obstacle one at a time, experimenting and learning from each experiment.
- Waste is anything that causes deviation from the perfect process: a process, without interruptions, that gives the customer exactly what they want, in the amount they want, when they want it.
- Jidoka is a pillar of the Toyota Production System to stop when there is a quality problem and immediately solve the problem.
- Gemba is where the work is done, where we can observe the reality.
- Just-in-Time means "the right part at the right time in the right amount".
- Built-in Quality is when quality is integrated in every step of a process to prevent defects, not only at the end.
- Takt is the rate of customer demand.
- One-piece flow is that "perfect" process where each step does what it is supposed to do without waste. We can recognize that there is no perfect process, but we're always striving to achieve it.

**1. I am my position:** If I focus on my position only, I have little sense of responsibility for the results when all positions interact.

**2. The enemy is out there:** If we don't see how positions or departments interact, we don't see how our own actions extend beyond that position or department.

**3. The illusion fo taking charge:** When we respond to issues only reacting to events, we are not seeing how we contribute to our problems.

**4. The fixation on events:** Focusing on events distracts us from seeing the longer-term patterns that lie behind the events and from understanding the root causes of these patterns.

**5. The parable of the boiled frog:** Organizations can't feel they are in the middle of a crisis until they slow down and look at the processes that pose the greatest threats.

**6. The delusion of learning from experience:** When organizations try to solve their difficulties by breaking themselves up in components, analysis of the most complex issues that cross functional lines becomes a non-existing exercise.

**7. The myth of the management team:** When organizations try to defend their traditional ways of doing things rather than to question tem, they stop developing the capacity to change those ways.
