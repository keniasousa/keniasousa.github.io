During my bachelor in computer science, my favorite subjects were Operational Research with [Prof. Placido Pinheiro][placido]{:target="_blank"}, Artificial Intelligence with [Prof. Vasco Furtado][vasco]{:target="_blank"} and Software Engineering with Prof. Arnaldo Belchior, <i>in memoriam</i>. Early on, I was enchanted by an internship at [IVIA][ivia]{:target="_blank"}, where I learned to program real applications, and another one on academic research in [NATI, an IT research center][nati]{:target="_blank"} at the [University of Fortaleza][unifor]{:target="_blank"}.

Academia gave me the opportunity to be creative and I was drawn to do my Masters, specializing in usability, user-centered design and software development process with [Prof. Elizabeth Furtado][beth]{:target="_blank"}. The best memories of that time were usability tests with users.

My [academic contribution][kenia]{:target="_blank"} was quite significant that [Prof. Jean Vanderdonckt][jean]{:target="_blank"} invited me to do my PhD in [Universit√© catholique de Louvain][ucl]{:target="_blank"}, at the [Louvain School of Management][lsm]{:target="_blank"} in Belgium. My PhD was a wonderful time to read and write (a lot!), travel around the world presenting my work and collaborating with people. My memorable reward was receiving the [IBM PhD Fellowship Award][ibm-award]{:target="_blank"} in 2009, which gave me the opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Noi Sukaviriya][noi]{:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Richard Hull][rick]{:target="_blank"} at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in New York on interactive design and business process management.

Each of these professors and researchers have made a big impact on my life personally and professionally. They have shared with me not only their deep knowledge on a subject, but also their love for learning and sharing.
