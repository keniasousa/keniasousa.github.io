I am Kenia Sousa, mom to two beautiful and creative kids and wife to an amazing
man. I'm currently a business analyst of one of the biggest education programmes
of the European Commission, [Erasmus+][erasmus-plus]{:target="_blank"}. I elicit requirements leading
workshops, model business processes using BPMN, specify system impact, create
prototypes, support creating user manuals, monitor processes and identify and
apply process improvements.

I have a PhD in Economics and Management Sciences, achieved with a strong academic
participation with several publications and a thesis on usability for business.
Since my Masters, I had been focused in usability because
of its direct impact on people. What impressed me the most was how small changes
in user interfaces make a huge difference in how people perform their tasks. When
I started to bring this idea to companies, I got immediately drawn to the issues
they had in their processes and saw how much usability could improve these
processes. So, I wrote my PhD thesis on bridging the gap between
usability and business processes.

In 2011 I became a mother and it made me a different person. I
discovered a strength and desire to succeed more powerful than ever. Before my
kids, success was about having fun, afterwards, it was a commitment.
I became more eager to learn new things and be a better version
of myself each day.

The greatest events in my life have made me value:

- Balance: Every Wednesday, I go to the local market looking for organic fruits,
vegetables and bread. I have started a new process of conscious choices. I donate
or sell what's no longer used, give the proper destiny for what is broken, and recycle as much
as possible. Even though every action seems to have a minor impact, I'm proud
of how far they have taken me to lead a healthier and more sustainable
life.

- Equality: I have a boy and a girl and you will often see me teaching them to
dance, cook, play with any kind of toy, be strong and kind, both of them,
irrespective of their gender. Of course, he is an athletic boy and she is a sweet
girl. But she is also active and decisive, and he is also caring and attentive.
I value each of their unique personality traits and I don't label them to be
anything different than what they want to be.

- Patience: For a long time, I have been anxious. On one end, it has helped me to
be that focused person who achieves her goals. On the other hand, Yoga helped me
tame whatever was not valuable from that anxiety. I have gone through pregnancies, natural
births, demanding projects, and other cases of "make a dream
come true" or more mundane activities of toddler education that constantly put
me to test. Patience is a daily, useful exercise!

- Simplicity: My concept of simplicity is to value wellbeing and
life experiences more than owning things. Freedom from standards make it easier
to follow my unique path and make changes more easily. The more I study, the more
I see that actions have to be direct and simple to be efficient.

I have a passion for cooking. I'm constantly looking for and trying new recipes.
Cooking has greatly influenced me, but it goes beyond health, it makes me feel
life as an act of love. The strongest memories I have from my beloved late grandma
are the smell and taste of her unique food. If I could use my work vocabulary:
Food is a deliverable with immediate user feedback and it better be good!

One year ago, I have taken the challenge to start Aikido. It has definitely
changed who I am. It has taught me not to be afraid of making mistakes and that has
given me the chance to try until I get it done. Now, I am more confident in my
movements and that resonates in every single aspect of my life, making me
a better person, more balanced and healthier.
